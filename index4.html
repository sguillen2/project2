<h1 class="border"> <font size="5" color="Orange">Welcome to my fourth page, as said on the home screen I will be talking about why PS4 can be a bad console. PS4 is like any other electronic device and as you probably know most electronic devices mess up. Some people have errors with a lagging device because either their console is old, or they have a lot of games downloaded. With a laggy console it can be pretty hard to play the game you want to play and have a good experience. Some other people experience their PS4 being loud and noisy. This happens because there is dust covering over the PS4 fan and it will become loud. Even though you can fix this error by cleaning the dust and your console, it is still annoying because you have to take your time and clean your console. This is just two of many problems PS4 has.
