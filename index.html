<h1 class="border" <font size="5" color="yellow"> Welcome to the big Discussion. Is PS4 better than Xbox?</h1>
<p class="border"> <font size="5" color="yellow">So this isn't confusing for you, let me explain what pages I have and what order my pages will be in. On this page I will have some debates on why people think PS4 is better and why people think Xbox is better. My second and third pages will be my opinions on PS4 and Xbox. Finally on my fourth and fifth pages I will give reasons why PS4 and Xbox are bad consoles.</p>
