<h1 class="border"> <font size="5" color="Red">Welcome to my last page. I will be giving some reasons on why Xbox can be a bad console as well. Most Xbox users claim that their console will freeze and they would have to restart their entire console. By restarting it,it can take up to five minutes to load into the game of your choice. Some xbox game disc also scratch easily and you would have to go to a store and fix the disk. Or some people even have to buy a new game. Xbox gives you the option to make your own avatar, but the options are kind of broken. Say you want a specif hairstyle on your avatar: the hair can mess up and it won't be the character you want it to be.These are just few of many problems Xbox has. In conclusion PS4 is better.
