<h1> <font size="4" color="Black"> My opinion on PS4 is that it is actually better than Xbox. I say this because of many reasons. I have a PS4 myself and I have had no issues with it. I've had it for almost 2 years and it works perfectly fine. It was also $100 cheaper, I've played xbox before and I see no difference in the graphics. Also on PS4 you don't need to buy PS plus to talk to others and some games you can play with your friends for free! xbox requires you to buy a subscription to talk and play with others.</h1>
